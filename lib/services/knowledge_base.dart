  DEVICE DIAGNOSTIC KNOWLEDGE BASE (Philippines & Davao Market Focus):

  **1. Common Device Issues & Symptoms:**
  - **Battery Degradation:** Rapid discharge (<80% health), overheating during charging, unexpected shutdowns. Common after 2-3 years.
  - **Screen Damage:**
    - *LCD/OLED Failure:* Black spots, green lines, unresponsive touch, "ghost touch."
    - *Physical Damage:* Visible cracks, deep scratches.
  - **Water Damage:** Discolored moisture indicators (usually inside SIM tray), foggy camera lens, corroded charging port, unresponsive buttons.
  - **Software Issues:** Frequent app crashes, slow UI, boot loops, failed updates.
  - **Hardware Failures:**
    - *Speaker/Mic:* Crackling audio, no sound during calls.
    - *Camera:* Blurry photos, black screen in camera app, focus issues.
    - *Charging Port:* Loose connection, requires specific cable angle to charge, no charging.
  - **Motherboard/Logic Board Issues:** No power, no display even with a new screen, overheating with no specific cause.

  **2. Device Value Factors (Philippines Context):**
  - **Age & Model:** Newer models (iPhone 12+, Samsung S21+) retain value well. Older models (iPhone 8, Samsung S9) have lower but stable value.
  - **Market Demand (Davao):** High demand for iPhones, Samsung A-series, and budget brands like Xiaomi/Realme.
  - **Condition:**
    - *Pristine/Mint:* No visible flaws. Highest value.
    - *Good:* Minor, barely visible scratches.
    - *Fair:* Visible scratches, minor dents.
    - *Damaged:* Cracked screen/back, major dents, known hardware issues. Lowest value.
  - **Storage Capacity:** Higher storage (128GB+) significantly increases value.
  - **"GPP" / Carrier Locked Units:** Lower value than "Factory Unlocked" (FU) units.
  - **Repairs History:** Use of non-original parts (replacement screens/batteries) can lower value.

  **3. Repair Cost Estimates (Davao City, Greenhills price reference):**
  - **iPhone Screen:**
    - *LCD (iPhone 8-11):* ₱2,500 - ₱4,000
    - *OLED (iPhone X-14):* ₱5,000 - ₱12,000
  - **Android Screen:**
    - *LCD (Budget models):* ₱1,500 - ₱3,000
    - *OLED (Samsung A-series, etc.):* ₱3,500 - ₱7,000
    - *Curved OLED (Flagships):* ₱8,000 - ₱15,000
  - **Battery Replacement:**
    - *iPhone:* ₱1,200 - ₱2,500
    - *Android:* ₱800 - ₱2,000
  - **Charging Port Flex:** ₱800 - ₱1,800
  - **Water Damage Cleaning/Diagnosis:** ₱1,500 - ₱3,000 (no guarantee of fix)
  - **Motherboard Repair (Micro-soldering):* ₱3,000 - ₱10,000+ (high risk)

  **4. Model-Specific Information & Estimated Second-hand Value (Good Condition, FU):**
  - **iPhone 13 (128GB):** ~₱30,000 - ₱35,000. *Common issue: Occasional green screen tint.*
  - **iPhone 11 (64GB):** ~₱15,000 - ₱18,000. *Common issue: LCD discoloration at edges.*
  - **Samsung A52s (128GB):** ~₱10,000 - ₱12,000. *Common issue: Minor software bugs.*
  - **Xiaomi Note 10 Pro (128GB):** ~₱7,000 - ₱9,000. *Common issue: "Ghost touch" on some units.*

  **5. Recommended Actions Logic:**
  - **High Value (>₱20,000):** Repair is viable if cost is < 40% of post-repair value.
  - **Medium Value (₱8,000 - ₱20,000):** Repair if essential (screen, battery). Multiple issues may not be worth it.
  - **Low Value (<₱8,000):** Minor repairs only. Often better to sell "as-is" for parts, donate, or recycle.
  - **Cracked Screen + Other Major Issue:** Usually not worth repairing unless it's a very new model.
